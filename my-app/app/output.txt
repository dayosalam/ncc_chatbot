This regulation can be accessed via the link below: http://www.ncc.gov.ng/licensing-regulatory/legal/regulations\nThe Nigerian Communications Act 2003. The Act can be accessed via the link below: http://www.ncc.gov.ng/documents/128-nigerian-communications- act-2003/file\nWhat is Quality of Service\nAnswer: Quality of service (QoS) is the collective effect of service performance which determines the degree of satisfaction of a user of the service indicating the performance of a network and of the degree to which the network conforms to the stipulated norms.\nWhy are QoS standards important?\nAnswer: The QoS standards ensure that consumers continue to have access to high quality telecommunications service by setting basic minimum quality levels for all operators. These standards define the lower and upper bounds of acceptability of such issues as Call Setup Success Rate, Call Drop Rate, Handover Success Rate, call completion rates, etc. and commercial consumer issues such as access to customer care centres, billing integrity and other characteristics that can be measured and improved.\nWhy does QoS matters?\nAnswer: Quality of service is a major factor in ensuring optimum consumer/provider relations because by demanding a certain ‘quality of service ‘the consumer is empowered to:\nSelect the service provider that best satisfies their specific needs\nObtain optimum value for money\nJudge the level of service with which they are provided\nEvaluate service level Agreements correctly\nMake informed decisions.\nWhat levels of service should the consumer expect?\nAnswer: The consumer is entitled to expect the following levels of service or quality of service provision:\nValue for money\nEase of use of the service or product\nProfessionalism, on the part of the service provider, in the provision of the service.\nFlexibility in the use of the service on the part of the consumer for instance, the ease with which the consumer is able to switch from one operator to another, from one resource to another, etc.\nThe product or service should perform according to expectations and as specified.\nThe consumers are well informed and make an informed choice\nWhat are the QoS metrics being used by NCC to assess the performance of operators?\nAnswer: NCC currently uses 13 QoS metrics and are clearly defined in the NCC website.\nThe technical parameters for 2G are enumerated below:\nCall Setup Success Rate (Number of the unblocked call attempts divided by the total number of call attempts. Or (1 - Blocking Probability) x 100%.\nDrop Call Rate (The Dropped Call Rate (sometimes called Call Drop Rate) is the number of dropped calls divided by the total number of call attempts. Or (1 - Call Completion Ratio) x 100%)\nTraffic Channel Congestion Rate (This is the percentage congestion of the TCH measured at the busy hour)\nStand-Alone Dedicated Channel Congestion (Dropped SDCCH Connections of the Total Number of SDCCH Connections without TCH Congestion)\nHandover Success Rate (This is the ratio of the number of successfully completed handovers to the total number of initiated handovers. This ratio can be expressed as a percentage)\nCall Completion Rate (The ratio of successfully completed calls to the total number of attempted calls (ITU-T E600/2.13). That is, the ratio of the number of completed call attempts to the total number of call attempts, at a given point of a network)\nRoute Congestion (This is the percentage congestion of the Circuits measured at busy hour).\nRoute Availability (Amount of time the routes were in/out of service during a given period excluding planned outage\nCell Availability (Amount of time cells were in/out of service during a given period excluding planned outage)\nCall Setup Time (Time interval between the end of dialing by the user and the reception by him of the appropriate ring back tone or recorded announcement, or the abandonment of the call without a tone.\nMean Opinion Score (is the speech quality perceived by Caller or Called party in accordance with ITU-T P.862.\nAnswer Seizure Ratio (ASR) (is the ratio of the number of successful calls over the total number of outgoing calls from a carrier’s network (i.e. On a route or a Destination Point Code (DPC) basis, and during a specified time interval, the ratio of the number of seizures that result in an answer signal to the total number of seizures: ITU-T E600/2.14).\nPost Dialing Delay (In GSM network, is the average time between pressing send button (after pressing correct digits) and getting a ring back tone. This is also called “Call Setup Time” or time to connect a call)\nThe technical parameters for 3G are enumerated below:\nCall Setup Success Rate (PS)\nCall Setup Success Rate (CS)\nRRC connection establishment success rate (PS)\nRRC connection establishment success rate (CS)\nRAB Establishment Success Rate\nHSUPA Setup Success Ratio [%] for Streaming(S), Interactive(I) and Background(B) Services\nHSDPA Setup Success Ratio [%] for Streaming(S), Interactive(I) and Background(B)\nIub Congestion ix. RRC Congestion\nCircuit Switched RAB Congestion\nPaging Success Rate\nCS RAB Abnormal Release Rate\nPS RAB Abnormal Release Rate\nSoft Handover Success Rate\nInter RAT Handover Success Rate for CS Domain\nCell Availability (or Node-B Accumulated downtime (not available for service)\nAverage Downlink Throughput per User\nCS Call setup time (CST) for on-net calls\nHow do NCC measure the performance of operators?\nAnswer: The following are the methods used by the NCC to measure the performance of operators.\nMonthly visitation to operators Network Operating Centers (NOC) to collect raw data of the Key performance Indicators for the purpose of analysis.\nDrive test in some major cities.\nAutomatic collation of QoS data from operators systems and automatic Subscriber perceived QoS measurements.\nWhy is it that some subscribers experience unacceptable QoS in some locations in a month, but the QoS performance result published on the NCC website shows that the operators met their QoS KPI targets for the month?\nAnswer: The QoS KPI performance report is reported as an average at the national and state levels respectively. Hence an area may be having a challenge with QoS but when the QoS performance in the area is averaged with other areas in the state or at the national level, the averaged result is usually better than unacceptable QoS experienced in any one of the component locations. However, NCC engages operators to ensure the QoS performance challenges in any of the identified locations are resolved.\nWhat are In-Building Solutions (IBS)?\nAnswer: IBS are a system of distributed antennas and base station equipment meant to provide telecommunications coverage in enclosed locations like high rise buildings, large buildings, hotels, shopping malls, offices etc. IBS are needed in these buildings as the telecommunications signal from external sites deployed by operators are absorbed by the building walls and fading degradation of the signal with increasing distance from the telecommunications site.\nWhy is it that sometimes when calls are made to people whose lines are switched on, a message saying the subscriber is unavailable is received?\nAnswer: This is due to any or a combination of the following reasons:\nThe subscriber is in an area with minimal network coverage due to:\nThe called subscriber being in an location with little or no network coverage like high rise or large buildings or shopping malls without In-building solutions\nThe called subscriber may be on the highway with no network coverage\nThe called subscriber may be at the outskirt of town with no network coverage\nThe shutdown of the operator site serving the area by a landlord, site shutdown due to theft of operator site generator, theft of batteries, theft of diesel, security issues in accessing the site, or community issues preventing an operator from servicing the impacted site, or site shutdown by agencies of government, etc.\nCut in the fibre optic cable that conveys all the calls made in a group of sites across the country due to construction activities, vandalisation, etc.\nThe subscriber handset may be of sub-standard\nPlanning and optimization errors from operators\nWhy does a subscriber experience dropped calls?\nAnswer: The following are some of the reasons subscribers experience dropped calls.\nInability of operator to deploy required new sites due to difficulties in acquiring new site locations to deploy their equipment\nSub-optimal definition of neighboring cells by operators\nInability of operator to cover the site operational expenses for a site to be deployed in the location\nInadequate network capacity\n\n\n\n\n ---'), Document(page_content='--- \n\n\nCOMPLIANCE MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT:\nHas the government made any special arrangements for Nigerians living in the diaspora with regard to the NIN registration and subsequent deadline?\nANSWER: In 2019, the National Identity Management Commission commenced the diaspora enrolment exercise at designated centres located in Nigeria’s High Commissions abroad. This is aimed at capturing Nigerians living outside the country into the National Identity Database.\nHow does the Commission intend to rid the streets permanently of pre-registered SIM cards?\nANSWER: The Commission carries out periodic enforcement and audit exercises to check the prevalence of pre-registered SIM cards. It also collaborates with the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and security agencies to apprehend and prosecute offenders.\nIn cases of fraud carried out during illegal SIM swap, who bears the liability? The network operator or the financial institution (Bank)?\nANSWER: This issue is largely still in contention. Although, since it is a criminal offence, it is referred to the Police for investigation. The negligent party would be made to bear liability.\nAre children also required to link their MSISDNs to the NIN?\nANSWER: Yes, although there are additional requirements for the registration of children which include the provision of the Parents/Guardian’s NIN slip along with supporting documents in proof of the relationship.\nIn the event that customers are unable to link all their SIM Cards to the NIN and those SIM Cards get blocked, the Mobile Network Operators lose a sizable number of their customer base. Wouldn’t this lead to disastrous economic consequences?\nANSWER: The Federal Government has further extended the deadline for Nigerians to link their National Identification Numbers (NIN) to their SIM cards till June 30, 2021.\nHow do I file a complaint of a Consumer’s non-compliance to the Commission?\nANSWER: Submit a detailed letter regarding the issue to the Commission, attentioned to the EVC.\nHow do I file a complaint against an MNO for poor Quality of Service?\nANSWER: Submit a complaint regarding the issue to the Commission, attentioned to the EVC and by social media handles i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.\nWhere can I learn more about Enforcement activities?\n ANSWER: On the NCC website, ncc.gov.ng.

The Commission is legally obligated to get warrants from a High Court judge, in order to access private property.\nWhat is the most common Enforcement action that is carried out?\nANSWER: Enforcement against fully activated SIM Cards.\nWhat are the issues that may lead to Enforcement action being carried out on the Consumer?\nANSWER: Issues that leads to enforcement action on a Consumer are the use of fraudulently Registered SIM cards.\n\n\n\n\n --- \n\n\nCUSTOMER AFFAIRS BUREAU: \nWhat is the first thing a dissatisfied consumer of telecom services do in order to get his/her problem resolved?\nANSWER: A dissatisfied consumer should first of all contact his/her Service Provider who will resolve the problem, please note that your Service Provider is to issue you a Complaint Ticket Number. Where the consumer is still dissatisfied, He /She may lodge a complaint with the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) Contact Centre for redress.\nWhat information must be provided in the written complaint?\nANSWER: The written complaint must state the following:\nName\nAddress\nAffected phone number(s)\nEmail of the dissatisfied consumer,\nComplaint description\nOther relevant information include:\nThe date you first contacted your Service Provider\nCopies of any relevant supporting document such as Service agreement, bills, promotional leaflet, etc. which would assist in our investigation.\nHow can I get information about the Commission?\nANSWER: For enquiries about the Commission, kindly log onto www.ncc.gov.ng or call the NCC Toll free line NCC (622).\nWhat information must be provided in the Online Complaint Form?\nANSWER: The Complaint Form must have a valid Ticket Number, Name, Address, phone number(s), e-mail of the dissatisfied Consumer and a brief description of the Complaint.\nWhat is a Toll-Free Number and how does it work?\nANSWER: Toll-Free numbers are numbers that allow callers to reach businesses without being charged for the call. The charge for using a Toll-Free is paid by the called party (the Toll-free subscriber) instead of the calling party. Toll-free Numbers have proven successful for businesses particularly in the areas of customer service. The following are examples of toll-free numbers of telecom companies in Nigeria:\n180 – MTN Customer Care Line\n111 – Airtel Customer Care Line\n121 – Globacom Customer Care Line\n200 – 9mobile Customer Care line\n400 – Ntel Customer Care Line\nWhat happens when a consumer complaint is received by NCC Consumer Affairs Bureau?\nANSWER: The Consumer Affairs Bureau analyses the complaint and starts investigations immediately. Where the Bureau is satisfied that the Service provider has breached terms of its contract with the consumer or contravened the provisions of the Nigeria Communication Act 2003 and the Consumer Code of Practice regulation etc., the Bureau will contact service provider and report findings to the NCC on the outcome. The Bureau will mediate as appropriate to resolve the issues.\nWill NCC Consumer Affairs Bureau get back to the consumer who lodged a complaint?\nANSWER: Yes, in the case where investigation are conclude in less than 48 hours, the dissatisfied consumer will be reached by phone or e-mail otherwise he/she will be communicated in writing, on the outcome of the investigation.\nDo I have to pay for the services of the Consumer Affairs Bureau?\nANSWER: No, the services of the CAB are rendered FREE OF CHARGE.\nCan an aggrieved consumer sue the Service Provider in a court of law over a breach of contract?\nANSWER: Yes.

The right to good quality of service, etc. However, note that consumers also have some obligations.\nHow can NCC protect my right as a Telecoms user?\nANSWER:\nBy mediating between the consumer and the Operators\nProtecting consumers against fraudulent and unscrupulous dealings.\nBy educating consumers through the dissemination of relevant information. .\nWhat avenues for redress are available within NCC?\nANSWER: The NCC has two distinct redress processes available to a displeased consumer:\nConsumer Complaints Resolution.\nArbitration Process.\nWhat issues can consumers complain to NCC about?\nANSWER: Consumers can lodge complaints on the following issues amongst others: doubtful billings, arbitrary disconnection of lines, nonchalant attitude towards genuine complaints, poor services delivery, inappropriate deceptive advertisements, unauthorized increase in price and supply of sub-standard equipment, exploitation and invasion of privacy.\nIs NCC a Governmental Agency?\nANSWER: Yes, NCC is a full-fledged government agency with independent status to effectively regulate the activities of the operators, suppliers and consumers in the Telecommunications Industry.\nWhat is Telecom Consumer Parliament?\nANSWER: The Telecoms Consumer Parliament serves as a Platform for consumer education and protection, as well as an avenue for telecom consumers to present their issues and problems directly to the Operators for resolution. It is a Forum convened by NCC, the industry regulator which draws participants from operating companies, consumers and officials of the Commission. The proceedings are usually televised in National Media. It features Civil Society groups, consumer rights groups and members of the Mass Media.\nAre all issues raised at the Telecom Consumer Parliament resolved on the spot?\nANSWER: Some of the issues raised are resolved depending on their nature. Others are resolved after the programme. To ensure that such issues are resolved, NCC formally communicates those concerns to the Operators for resolution with definite time frames. The Commission follows up to ensure amicable resolutions.\nWhere and when is it held?\nANSWER: The Telecoms Consumer Parliament is held at a designated City or Town within a geo-political zone in Nigeria once every Quarter,in a year.

It is a second generation mobile telephony system that is currently the international standard for wireless technology. GSM allows users to utilize one phone and one number in many countries throughout the world.\nWhat is a SIM card?\nANSWER: The SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is the smart card inserted inside all GSM Phones containing the telephone number of the subscriber, encoded network identification details, the PIN and many other user data such as the phone book. Unless restrictions are placed on the individual handsets by Network Operators, a GSM user’s SIM card can be moved from phone to phone as it contains all the key information required to activate the phone.\nIs it true that the use of GSM (cell) phones is harmful to human beings?\nANSWER: There is no scientific evidence to support the contention that the use of mobile phone is harmful to human beings. The global scientific community is of the opinion that the low powered radio signal produced by mobile phones does not have sufficient intrinsic energy, and therefore, cannot pose health hazard to any kind of man.\nHow do I protect my SIM against any unauthorized use?\nANSWER: Each SIM has a Personal Identification Number (PIN) which is a 4-digit code to protect it against any unauthorized use. The user has the ability to change the PIN, or set protocols for its use.
