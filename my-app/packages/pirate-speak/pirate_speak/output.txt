The NIN is issued upon enrolment by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). NIMC is the government agency responsible for identity management in Nigeria.\nWhat is the purpose of the NIN?\nThe NIN is a digital identity unique to the holder. It is used to match the individual with his or her biometrics (fingerprint and facial) data and other details in the National Identity Database. It is the most authentic way by which a citizen’s identity can be verified and/or authentic\nHow do I obtain my NIN?\nTo get your NIN, you will need to register in any NIMC enrolment centre close to you. Please visit NIMC website www.nimc.gov.ng for a list of all enrolment centres.\nIs it possible to register NIN online without visiting the registration centre?\nNIMC has made arrangements for you to commence the enrolment process by first filling the enrolment form online. However, to complete the NIN registration process, you must visit an approved registration centre. This is because in addition to the capture of demographic information (e.g. your names, address, etc.), registration requires the physical capture of biometric data (your face and fingerprint). You therefore have to visit accredited enrolment centres for the capture of your full biometric data.\nCan I obtain or update NIN for my Spouse, Relative, Friend or Boss?\nNo, you cannot. Everyone is to enrol for his or her NIN individually.

How long can the process of obtaining a NIN take?\nIndividuals who do not have a NIN are to proceed to the nearest accredited NIN enrolment centres to enrol/register for NIN. NIMC has assured that it will generate the NIN within one to five working days after data capture is completed and all details verified – see more details of the process on the NIMC website at https://nimc.gov.ng/how-to-enrol-adults/ .\nIf I have enrolled before, how do I confirm my NIN?\nYou can confirm your NIN in two easy steps:\nCheck the slip issued to you by NIMC when you enrolled. Your NIN is the 11-digit number on the top left-hand corner of the slip; or\nDial *346# on your phone and press 1 to retrieve your NIN. Please note that you can only retrieve your NIN on the same phone number you registered with NIMC.\nCan the NIN only be obtained at NIMC’s Offices?\nOther government institutions, state governments and private companies have been approved by NIMC as Enrolment Centres to enrol citizens for the NIN. Mobile operators have also been licensed and will soon be carrying out the enrolment of their subscribers and other eligible citizens.\nAre banks among the accredited establishments for issuance of NIN?\nYES. Some banks have been licensed to carry out NIN enrolment; however, please note that only NIMC issues NIN although through accredited enrolment partners.\nIs NIN automatically allocated to all BVN holders or must I register for and obtain NIN separately even though I already have a BVN?\nBVN is being harmonized with NIMC, therefore some BVN holders have been automatically allocated NIN. BVN holders are advised to dial *346# with the mobile number linked to their BVN to confirm if they have been allocated a NIN. However, NINs generated via BVN must be verified and validated by NIMC.\nIs the list of accredited registration agents circulating online genuine?\nThe Nigerian government recently licensed 173 Private Sector Agents and thirty (30) State Governments/Public Sector Institutions to conduct enrolment of all persons, including legal residents into the National Identity Database (NIDB) on behalf of NIMC. The authentic list is published on the NIMC website at;\n\xa0\xa0\xa0https://nimc.gov.ng/public-notice-approved-data-capturing-agents-digital-identity-ecosystem/\xa0\xa0\nAny list that does not emanate from NIMC is to be disregarded.\nWhich is the right organization to issue NIN?\nNIMC is the Identity Regulator of Nigeria and has sole authority and responsibility to issue NIN. However, NIMC has accredited other entities (such as those mentioned in Q11 above) as enrolment agents to facilitate the issuance of NIN to all eligible citizens in quick time.\nHow possible is it to carry out the NIN registration without breaching COVID-19 Protocols?\nAppropriate measures are being put in place by NIMC in accredited enrolment centres, to ensure that COVID-19 protocols are strictly complied with to avoid further spread of the virus.\nOne of such measures is the licensing of over 200 entities to carry out the enrolment of citizens so that NIMC offices are not besieged by too many people.\nIn all circumstances, persons are strongly advised to take personal responsibility by strictly observing the COVID-19 Protocols (wearing face mask, keeping appropriate social distance, hand sanitizing etc).\nSECTION B: Linking Your NIN With Your Mobile Number\nWhy am I being asked to submit my NIN to my Network provider?\nBy submitting your NIN to your mobile network provider your mobile number will be linked to your NIN, thereby providing a means of verifying your identity and safeguarding both your identity and mobile line.\nWhat is the step by step approach for linking a SIM to NIN?\nConfirm your NIN (by either checking your NIN enrolment slip issued by NIMC or dialling *346# as explained in Q.10 above.\nSubmit your NIN to your network provider(s) via the online, USSD or other channels provided.\nYour Mobile Network provider will then validate the submitted NIN on NIMC database and link the SIM to NIN if validation is successful.\nIs there a way people can find out their NIN without a slip, especially if the slip is lost or damaged?\nYES. Individuals who have done their NIN registration but have lost their slip, or are without a slip, can retrieve their NIN from NIMC by dialling USSD code *346# with the phone number that was provided to NIMC during their national identity registration.\nDoes *346# work on all networks?\nYES, the USSD code works for all networks. However, if you have registered for a NIN and you keep getting an error message, please dial your service provider’s help line. If you are yet to register for NIN please visit any NIMC Enrolment Centres (ERC) close to you to enrol or visit www.nimc.gov.ng for the list of all enrolment centres nationwide.\nIs there an alternate USSD code for submitting NIN or linking SIM to NIN other than *346#?\nYes, you can use *996# and follow the steps to link NIN; or use *996*NIN# to submit NIN for linkage with SIM. The 996 code works across all networks.\nCan the NIN be linked to SIM without the physical presence of the subscriber?\nYES. Subscribers can link their NIN to their SIM through the online and USSD channels provided by their Network Provider(s). The process for doing this is explained in Q10 and Q.19.\nIf I have more than one phone number, is one NIN appropriate and how do I link them?\nAn individual’s NIN is his/her unique identity number. Persons with multiple lines are required to update their SIM records by submitting their NIN to their different Network Providers.\nThe different Networks have provided simple solutions, which include short codes to help you link your NIN to your different SIMS.\nFor\xa0MTN, dial\xa0*785#\xa0using the phone number you wish to link, enter your NIN and submit or dial *785*Your NIN# from the phone number you wish to link.\nFor\xa0Airtel, dial\xa0*121*1#\xa0on the Airtel line you wish to link, type 1 for NIN Capture and press send, enter your NIN and wait for the message confirming submission.\nFor\xa0Globacom, simply send “UPDATENIN NIN FirstName and LastName” to 109. For example, send “UPDATENIN 12345678912 Tony Umoh” to 109\nFor\xa09Mobile, simply visit the online self-service NIN update portal at\xa0www.9mobile.com.ng/NIN\xa0\nWhat happens after I provide my NIN to the mobile network provider?\nThe Network provider will work with the NCC and NIMC to verify the NIN you submitted. You will be notified in due course whether your SIM has been successfully linked to your NIN or whether you need to provide any further details.\nIf I don’t have a NIN or fail to submit to my Network Provider, will my line be blocked after the deadline?\nThe Ministerial Task Force on the NIN and SIM registration has extended the deadline for subscribers who have NIN to three (3) weeks from December 30, 2020 to January 19, 2021.\nFor subscribers without NIN, the enrolment deadline has been extended by six (6) weeks from December 30, 2020 to February 9, 2021.\nSubscribers are strongly advised to use this period to ensure they enrol for their NIN and link same with their SIM as SIMs not linked may be blocked from the network after the deadline.\nHow authentic are the links circulating online for SIM update? E.g. is the code *346# genuine for retrieval of NIN and others?\nYES. The *346# USSD code provided by NIMC is genuine for retrieval of NIN. Please note that only links and channels communicated by Mobile Network Providers, NIMC or NCC are authentic.\nWhy is the exercise (of linking the SIM to NIN) not free of charge for people? – Why the N20.00 charge?\nThe linkage of SIM to NIN is free. NIMC has waived the N20.00 (Twenty Naira) NIN retrieval charge and other verification costs for the duration of the SIM update exercise.\nWhy did the NCC direct a halt to registration of new SIMs (even welcome back) and what does the NCC want to achieve with it?\nThe directive to halt the registration of new SIMs is to ensure compliance with set quality standards and requirements as well as address national security concerns surrounding the use of SIMs.\nHowever, the directive does not apply to SIM replacements (welcome back). Mobile Network Providers may perform SIM replacement for subscribers already registered and active on the network, provided that the subscriber presents a NIN and follows the prescribed procedures.\nIs the directive for reasons of security, harmonization of data, or for revenue as people are speculating due to the N20.00 charge by network operators for the use of *346# code?\nThe directive to link SIM to NIN is primarily to address national security concerns surrounding the use of SIMs. It is also for harmonization of data of all Nigerian residents so as to create an authentic national citizens database which government can use to improve serves to the citizenry and address security concerns. There is no revenue objective attached to the exercise, and to prove this, the Government has waived the N20 charge during the period of the registration.\nWill my bank account be blocked if my line is not linked to NIN?\nOnly SIM cards/phone lines that are not registered with the National Identity Numbers (NIN) will be blocked at the end of this exercise. Government may however introduce other measures it deems necessary in the best interest of all Nigerians in future.\nSECTION C: Nigerians In The Diaspora\nHow about Nigerians who live abroad? Will they be able to register for NIN and integrate their NIN with their SIMs?\nYES, NIMC has licensed foreign enrolment partners to register Nigerians in the diaspora and issue them the NIN. Please click\nhttps://www3.nimc.gov.ng/diaspora/\xa0for details of diaspora enrolment.\nChannels for integration of SIM to NIN have also been put in place for Nigerians in the Diaspora. This include using the mobile applications provided by the respective operators and the application recently launched by NIMC. This can be downloaded from the Apple and Google App Stores.\nSECTION D: Foreigners Living In Nigeria Or Visiting From Abroad\nAre foreigners living in Nigeria and using Nigerian mobile networks also affected by the directive?\nYes. All persons in Nigeria who use mobile networks are required to register their SIM cards and link them with the NIN database.\nAre foreigners required to obtain a NIN? And does having a NIN confer citizenship on a non-Nigerian?\nAll legally resident foreigners (i.e. non-Nigerians living and working in Nigeria) are to obtain a NIN just like Nigerian citizens. They can do this by submitting valid resident/work permits at NIMC enrolment centres. However, foreigners on tourist or visiting visa are to tender their international passports to acquire a SIM. But where such a visiting foreigner or tourist’s immigration status changes to residency or work permit, he/she will be required to obtain NIN and link the registered SIM.\nNIN does not confer citizenship on foreigners but only serves to identify a person (citizens and legal residents).\nSECTION E: Other Relevant Questions\nWhose job is it to update the SIM Registration Records with NIN? Is it the Network Providers, NIMC or NCC?\nWith regards to the directive by NCC (the regulator of the communications sector in Nigeria), on behalf of the Federal Government, Mobile Network Providers (MNOs) are to update SIM registration records with NIN. This will be done in collaboration with NIMC and the MNOs. More so other government institutions, state governments and private companies have been approved as enrolment agents to MNOs subscribers.\nWe have NIN, SIM, BVN etc. all have biometric information – which is a unique identifier, and all can be linked without disruption, and without most people even knowing that such linking/integration is taking place. If for example, the biometrics match (but the other details don’t), then you call the affected person in for a data cleaning exercise. There is really no rationale for this wholesale reinvention of the wheel – as is the case, presently. So why is NCC not adopting this approach?\nThe process described above is currently underway. The Federal Government recently announced that all agencies which collect biometric data should harmonise them with NIMC so that citizens do not have to provide the same information multiple times. Implementation of this is ongoing. For instance, the BVN is already being harmonized with NIN, the Nigerian Immigration Service now use NIMC data for verifying personal data, and the Federal Road Safety Commission recently announced ongoing harmonisation with the NIMC database.\nThe number of Nigerians enrolled in all of the databases mentioned above is relatively small in comparison to the number of mobile phone subscribers in the country. Also, there is a huge disconnect between the details provided by many Nigerians when registering their SIMs compared to what was provided for other databases. This is why the harmonisation cannot be carried out solely at the “back-end”.\nPlease note that the NCC is doing everything possible to minimise the inconveniences arising from this critical exercise. This is why alternate channels (such as USSD and SMS) are being used for the verification so that people who have registered for the NIN and who provided accurate information to both NIMC and mobile operators can simply link from the comfort of their mobile handsets.\nWhat other things should people know about SIM registration and update with NIN?\nFurther developments regarding the SIM update exercise will be communicated to the public as they unfold.\nInterested members of the public are advised to monitor developments at the website of the\nFederal Ministry Communications and Digital Economy at\xa0https://www.commtech.gov.ng/\nNIMC at\xa0https://nimc.gov.ng/\xa0 and the\nNCC at\xa0https://www.ncc.gov.ng/\n\n\n\n\n ---'), Document(page_content="--- \n\n\n\nPOLICY COMPETITION & ECONOMIC ANALYSIS:\nTelecom services especially data prices are too high. What is the Commission doing to bring down the prices of data?\nANSWER: The Commission does not regulate prices but puts in place policies that regulates the industry and ensures prices charged by operators are cost based, competitive and in line with international best practice.\nWhat does Fair Usage Policy (FUP) mean and how does it affect data services?\nANSWER: FUP is a policy utilized internationally by broadband providers of all types of mobile and fixed internet to ensure that every subscriber uses data in moderation. It is to ensure fair and equitable distribution of access to as many subscribers on the particular network.\nWhy can I not get End of Usage Notification for data services just as I get for voice services?\nANSWER: The directive on End of Data Notification has been concluded and is at a review stage. Consumers would be notified of data consumed per day as well as their data balances.\nHow can I verify that I am being charged the right price for data services by my service provider?\nANSWER: Presently, the only way to verify what each service provider is charging is by checking the data balance before and after usage, and comparing the difference representing the data consumed with the product’s business rules as stated in the product offering. The Commission is soon to issue directives on End-of-Use notifications to be indicated by service providers after each use.\nWhy do some operators deny access to unlimited plans when they have reached their fair usage policies and why is subscribed data depleted quickly before the validity period?\nANSWER: Based on the FUP, operators are only allowed to throttle down speed but not to deny access. In a situation when this happens, Subscribers are expected to report to their respective provider’s customer Care Personnel. Where this is not resolved, subscribers can then escalate the issue to the Commission.\nUnlimited data plans usually have fair usage policies which means that the subscriber has unlimited access within the duration of the plan but not unlimited data. When the subscriber consumes the given data allowance, the speed throttles down while the consumer can still enjoy data service on the network.\nWhy are bonus plans considered to be more expensive compared to non-bonus plan?\nANSWER: Bonuses are traditionally free add-ons to products on offer and tend to deplete faster than non-bonus plans. This can only be explained by the fact that it’s a bonus i.e. an additional gift in a way.\nWhy is subscribed data depleted quickly before the validity period?\nANSWER: The depletion of data is according to the subscriber’s usage.\nCan subscribers be reimbursed for any unauthorized data depletion?\nANSWER: Yes, provided the complaint is made first to the operator. If this is not resolved, it is escalated to the Commission and compensation is adequately made as soon as the claim is confirmed to be true\nCan unused data be rolled over?\nANSWER: Yes, unused data should be rolled over if the subscriber renews his data within the stipulated time. There is a direction issued by the Commission to this effect.\nWhat is the price floor for voice?\nANSWER: N6.40\nWhat is the price floor for Data?\nANSWER: None\nWhat is the current International Termination rate?\nANSWER: The Commission put in place an interim rate of N24.40. A cost study is currently being carried out by the Commission.\nWhat is the time frame allowed for the processing of tariff request?\nANSWER: 45 working days as stipulated in the guidelines for processing tariff.\nWho is eligible to apply for Tariff approval?\nANSWER: All licensees of the Commission\nWhat is the price floor and cap for SMS\nANSWER: The price floor for SMS is N1.02 and N4.00 respectively.\nDoes NCC Regulate Fintechs?\nANSWER: NCC does not regulate Fintechs in Nigeria. Fintechs are regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)\nWhat role does NCC play in the Nigerian Financial Inclusion Strategy?\nANSWER: NCC’s role is an enabler providing the infrastructure upon which the Fintech/ Mobile Money Operators and other solution providers ride on to extend services to end users\nWho issues License to Mobile Money Operators, Super Agents & Payment Service Bank (PSB)\nANSWER: CBN issues License to Mobile Money Operators, Super Agents & PSBs.\nDoes NCC charge Mobile Money Operators for short code allocation?\nANSWER: NCC does not charge Mobile Money Operators for issuance of short code. However, there is plan to start charging soon.\nCan NCC Licensees apply for CBN license?\nANSWER: NCC licensees can apply for CBN Money Mobile/Super Agents/Payment Service Bank license only after creating a Special Purpose Vehicle for the said business.\nWhat is Broadband Penetration?\nANSWER: Broadband penetration is defined as the total number of subscriptions to 3G & 4G divided by the population of the country. It measures the extent of access to broadband communications within the population of a particular Country.\nThe ratio is multiplied by 100 to represent broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants. The estimated Nigerian population is 190,886,311\nWhat does Fixed telephone subscriptions mean?\nANSWER: Fixed-telephone subscriptions refers to the sum of active number of fixed telephone lines, Voice-Over-IP (VoIP) subscriptions, Fixed Wireless Local Loop (WLL) subscriptions, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) voice channel equivalents and fixed public payphones.\nWhat is Mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions?\nANSWER: Mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions refer to the number of active subscriptions to a public mobile-telephone service that provide access to the PSTN using mobile cellular technology\nWhat is Teledensity?\nANSWER: Telephone density, or tele-density, is the number of telephone connections calculated at the ratio of one line to 100 of population as prescribed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), an international body that prescribes standards for telecommunication services.\nWhat is a Leased Line?\nANSWER: A leased line is a dedicated fixed-bandwidth used for symmetric data or voice services.\nWhat is LTE?\nANSWER: LTE simply means Long Term Evolution. It is a standard for 4G wireless broadband technology that offers increased network capacity and speed to mobile device users. LTE offers higher peak data transfer rates -- up to 100 Mbps downstream and 30 Mbps upstream. It also provides reduced latency, scalable bandwidth capacity and backward-compatibility with existing GSM and UMTS technology.\nWhat are Fixed Telephone Lines?\nANSWER: A fixed telephone line is an active line connecting the subscriber's terminal equipment to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) using copper, fiber or wireless local loop.\nHow can Competition in the Nigerian Telecoms Industry affect Consumers Behaviour?\nANSWER: Competition brings about market efficiency which leads to lower prices, increase in number of services and improved quality of service provided to consumers which in turn increases consumer choices. This means that when the telecoms market is fairly competitive consumers have power to select best service provider and service that suits their needs\nWhat is Anti-competitive behaviour and how does it affect Consumer Choices?\nANSWER: Anti-competitive behaviour is any action conducted by one or more service providers to make it difficult for any other service provider to compete fairly. This behaviour include actions that can hinder effective competition which may lead to lower or higher prices, reduce quality of service or discourage innovation. Anticompetitive behaviour limits consumers’ choice there by preventing them from getting a fair deal.\nWhat is the Nigerian Communications Commission doing to check anticompetitive behaviors?\nANSWER: The Commission has in place a Competition Practices Regulations (2007) which provides rules for promotion of competition in the telecoms industry, protection against misuse of market power and anti-competitive practices. The Commission makes determination whether a Service Provider or more are in a dominant position or have significant market power; and impose dominance obligations on them to prevent them from misusing their market power or exploiting the consumers. The Commission also fines and sanctions Service Providers who violate the Competition Practices Regulations 2007.\nWhat does it mean, when a Service Provider has a dominant position or significant market power?\nANSWER: A Service Provider is assumed to be in a dominant position when it has highest or significant proportion of market share, revenue, output, sales and capacity. In addition, one or more Service Providers can jointly or collectively be in a dominant position.\nWhat does Abuse of Dominant Position mean and how can it affect Telecoms Consumers?\nANSWER: A Service Provider can abuse it dominant position when it uses its market strength or advantage to prevent fair competition within the industry. Also, when a dominant Service Provider engages in anti-competitive behavior such as offering services at a lower price, compelling a consumer to use only its service thereby preventing another competing Service Provider from providing similar service, it is said that Service Provider is abusing its dominant position.\n\n\n\n\n --- \n\n\nQUALITY OF SERVICE (QOS):\nWhat are the guiding documents on Quality of Service?\nAnswer: The following are the principal guiding documents for Quality of Service regulation;\nQoS Regulation 2012. This regulation can be accessed via the link below: http://www.ncc.gov.ng/licensing-regulatory/legal/regulations\nThe Nigerian Communications Act 2003. The Act can be accessed via the link below: http://www.ncc.gov.ng/documents/128-nigerian-communications- act-2003/file\nWhat is Quality of Service\nAnswer: Quality of service (QoS) is the collective effect of service performance which determines the degree of satisfaction of a user of the service indicating the performance of a network and of the degree to which the network conforms to the stipulated norms.\nWhy are QoS standards important?\nAnswer: The QoS standards ensure that consumers continue to have access to high quality telecommunications service by setting basic minimum quality levels for all operators. These standards define the lower and upper bounds of acceptability of such issues as Call Setup Success Rate, Call Drop Rate, Handover Success Rate, call completion rates, etc. and commercial consumer issues such as access to customer care centres, billing integrity and other characteristics that can be measured and improved.\nWhy does QoS matters?\nAnswer: Quality of service is a major factor in ensuring optimum consumer/provider relations because by demanding a certain ‘quality of service ‘the consumer is empowered to:\nSelect the service provider that best satisfies their specific needs\nObtain optimum value for money\nJudge the level of service with which they are provided\nEvaluate service level Agreements correctly\nMake informed decisions.\nWhat levels of service should the consumer expect?\nAnswer: The consumer is entitled to expect the following levels of service or quality of service provision:\nValue for money\nEase of use of the service or product\nProfessionalism, on the part of the service provider, in the provision of the service.\nFlexibility in the use of the service on the part of the consumer for instance, the ease with which the consumer is able to switch from one operator to another, from one resource to another, etc.\nThe product or service should perform according to expectations and as specified.\nThe consumers are well informed and make an informed choice\nWhat are the QoS metrics being used by NCC to assess the performance of operators?\nAnswer: NCC currently uses 13 QoS metrics and are clearly defined in the NCC website.\nThe technical parameters for 2G are enumerated below:\nCall Setup Success Rate (Number of the unblocked call attempts divided by the total number of call attempts. Or (1 - Blocking Probability) x 100%.\nDrop Call Rate (The Dropped Call Rate (sometimes called Call Drop Rate) is the number of dropped calls divided by the total number of call attempts. Or (1 - Call Completion Ratio) x 100%)\nTraffic Channel Congestion Rate (This is the percentage congestion of the TCH measured at the busy hour)\nStand-Alone Dedicated Channel Congestion (Dropped SDCCH Connections of the Total Number of SDCCH Connections without TCH Congestion)\nHandover Success Rate (This is the ratio of the number of successfully completed handovers to the total number of initiated handovers. This ratio can be expressed as a percentage)\nCall Completion Rate (The ratio of successfully completed calls to the total number of attempted calls (ITU-T E600/2.13). That is, the ratio of the number of completed call attempts to the total number of call attempts, at a given point of a network)\nRoute Congestion (This is the percentage congestion of the Circuits measured at busy hour).\nRoute Availability (Amount of time the routes were in/out of service during a given period excluding planned outage\nCell Availability (Amount of time cells were in/out of service during a given period excluding planned outage)\nCall Setup Time (Time interval between the end of dialing by the user and the reception by him of the appropriate ring back tone or recorded announcement, or the abandonment of the call without a tone.\nMean Opinion Score (is the speech quality perceived by Caller or Called party in accordance with ITU-T P.862.\nAnswer Seizure Ratio (ASR) (is the ratio of the number of successful calls over the total number of outgoing calls from a carrier’s network (i.e. On a route or a Destination Point Code (DPC) basis, and during a specified time interval, the ratio of the number of seizures that result in an answer signal to the total number of seizures: ITU-T E600/2.14).\nPost Dialing Delay (In GSM network, is the average time between pressing send button (after pressing correct digits) and getting a ring back tone. This is also called “Call Setup Time” or time to connect a call)\nThe technical parameters for 3G are enumerated below:\nCall Setup Success Rate (PS)\nCall Setup Success Rate (CS)\nRRC connection establishment success rate (PS)\nRRC connection establishment success rate (CS)\nRAB Establishment Success Rate\nHSUPA Setup Success Ratio [%] for Streaming(S), Interactive(I) and Background(B) Services\nHSDPA Setup Success Ratio [%] for Streaming(S), Interactive(I) and Background(B)\nIub Congestion ix. RRC Congestion\nCircuit Switched RAB Congestion\nPaging Success Rate\nCS RAB Abnormal Release Rate\nPS RAB Abnormal Release Rate\nSoft Handover Success Rate\nInter RAT Handover Success Rate for CS Domain\nCell Availability (or Node-B Accumulated downtime (not available for service)\nAverage Downlink Throughput per User\nCS Call setup time (CST) for on-net calls\nHow do NCC measure the performance of operators?\nAnswer: The following are the methods used by the NCC to measure the performance of operators.\nMonthly visitation to operators Network Operating Centers (NOC) to collect raw data of the Key performance Indicators for the purpose of analysis.\nDrive test in some major cities.\nAutomatic collation of QoS data from operators systems and automatic Subscriber perceived QoS measurements.\nWhy is it that some subscribers experience unacceptable QoS in some locations in a month, but the QoS performance result published on the NCC website shows that the operators met their QoS KPI targets for the month?\nAnswer: The QoS KPI performance report is reported as an average at the national and state levels respectively. Hence an area may be having a challenge with QoS but when the QoS performance in the area is averaged with other areas in the state or at the national level, the averaged result is usually better than unacceptable QoS experienced in any one of the component locations. However, NCC engages operators to ensure the QoS performance challenges in any of the identified locations are resolved.\nWhat are In-Building Solutions (IBS)?\nAnswer: IBS are a system of distributed antennas and base station equipment meant to provide telecommunications coverage in enclosed locations like high rise buildings, large buildings, hotels, shopping malls, offices etc. IBS are needed in these buildings as the telecommunications signal from external sites deployed by operators are absorbed by the building walls and fading degradation of the signal with increasing distance from the telecommunications site.\nWhy is it that sometimes when calls are made to people whose lines are switched on, a message saying the subscriber is unavailable is received?\nAnswer: This is due to any or a combination of the following reasons:\nThe subscriber is in an area with minimal network coverage due to:\nThe called subscriber being in an location with little or no network coverage like high rise or large buildings or shopping malls without In-building solutions\nThe called subscriber may be on the highway with no network coverage\nThe called subscriber may be at the outskirt of town with no network coverage\nThe shutdown of the operator site serving the area by a landlord, site shutdown due to theft of operator site generator, theft of batteries, theft of diesel, security issues in accessing the site, or community issues preventing an operator from servicing the impacted site, or site shutdown by agencies of government, etc.\nCut in the fibre optic cable that conveys all the calls made in a group of sites across the country due to construction activities, vandalisation, etc.\nThe subscriber handset may be of sub-standard\nPlanning and optimization errors from operators\nWhy does a subscriber experience dropped calls?\nAnswer: The following are some of the reasons subscribers experience dropped calls.\nInability of operator to deploy required new sites due to difficulties in acquiring new site locations to deploy their equipment\nSub-optimal definition of neighboring cells by operators\nInability of operator to cover the site operational expenses for a site to be deployed in the location\nInadequate network capacity\n\n\n\n\n --- \n\n\nRESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT:\nWhat is the Procedure for the Award of Research Grants (Telecommunications-based Research Innovations Project)?\nANSWER: The Commission publishes Adverts in National Dailies and on her website, requesting Academics in Nigerian Tertiary Institutions to submit Proposals every year. The Adverts include the criteria for Grants.

Non fulfilment of the terms of Award could warrant a refund of all sums paid by the Commission. Additionally, the Researcher’s Institution will be disqualified from any future Grants, as Researchers from the Institution would not be considered in future Request for Proposals.\nWhat areas of research are acceptable for Telecommunications-based Research Innovation from Academics in Tertiary Institutions?\nANSWER: The Areas of Research will be stated clearly in the Advertorial each year. The Industry is continuously evolving and Research areas are designed to meet current challenges in the sector necessitating the Commission to define the areas of research each year.\nHow does the Commission intend to facilitate collaborations between Industry and Academia?\nANSWER: The Commission is vested with the mandate via the Research & Development Department to create interactive platforms to engage Industry experts and the Academia on productive discourse around Emerging Technologies. These interactive sessions/Foras include;\nResearch and Prototype Exposition - which is a platform to provide interactions between Academia-developed prototypes and funders for commercialization.\nRegional Roundtable with Academia, Industry and other Stakeholders’ Meetings across Six (6) Geopolitical Regions - which is a platform to discuss issues to enhance collaborations between the Academia and Industry.\nResearch Fellowship Programme – a platform for a one-year residence programme, providing opportunities to Academics to work full-time in the Industry (Commission) on sabbatical while assisting in critical research activities to enhance our regulatory functions and gaining some “field” experience and also Industry Experts to teach in the Tertiary Institutions.\nWhat does the Commission do to encourage Commercialization of prototypes from the Academia?\nANSWER: Strategies the Commission will undertake include;\nProtection of Intellectual Property (IP) rights: The Commission is collaborating with various Government agencies and extensively educating Researchers that benefitted from Telecoms-based Research Grants about intellectual property and copyright laws. However, the Government agency in charge of granting Trademarks, Patents and Designs Registry, is the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment.\nCreation of Multi- Sectorial Investment Platform: Creation of a Multi-Stakeholder Platform dedicated to showcasing and promoting already awarded Grants on pre-prototype stage and developed prototypes from the Academia. The Research and Prototype Exposition programme organized by the Commission provides a platform for the academia and other developers to pitch their ideas and prototypes to venture capitalists and other investors, commercialization experts, relevant government agencies, operators and vendors in the Communications Industry, to elicit interests.\nPublication of Research Outcomes: The Commission will publish and showcase finished Research Grant projects of the Telecoms Based Research Innovation from Academics in Nigeria Tertiary Institutions in the National Dailies.\nI am a Techpreneur. Is there a License for Internet of Things (IOT)?\nANSWER: No, the Commission does not currently licence IOT.\nDoes the Commission provide funding support for Tech Hubs, if so, how?\nANSWER: No, the Commission as a Government Agency can only provide funding support to public Institutions, and not to private entities. Tech Hub is a private business.\nIs there provision for free bandwidth and computing hardware for Tech Hubs?\nANSWER: No, there is no provision for free bandwidth and computing hardware for Tech Hubs.
